# An example of an optional config file for pick.
# If no config file is available, sensible defaults will be used.
# If you wish to use a config file, it must be located at ~/.pick/config.toml
# Variables:
# $HOME gets replaced with the path to your home directory, e.g. $HOME/.pick -> /home/john/.pick

# The storage section controls the configuration of the backend.

# Danger Area!
# Only adjust the settings below this line if you know what you are doing.
# If you change something and we update our recommended settings, your safe will
# _not_ automatically upgrade to our new recommendations.
# The encryption section controls the configuration of the safe encryption.
#[encryption]
# type let's you specify the encryption method to use.
# Currently supported values: "openpgp".
#type = "openpgp"
  # Settings for the "openpgp" type
  #[encryption.openpgp]
  # The cipher to use, currently supported: "aes256", "aes128".
  # The number after "aes" specifies the key length (in bits).
  #cipher = "aes256"
  # s2kcount sets the number of iterations used to derive a key from your password.
  # The more iterations, the longer it takes to convert your password to a key.
  # This increases the time required for e.g. dictionary-attacks.
  # Currently supported values: 1024-65011712 (inclusive).
  # Not all values in the 1024-65011712 range are legal and if an illegal value is selected,
  # the value is automatically rounded up to the nearest legal value.
  #s2kcount = 65011712
